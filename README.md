# Modern-React
Links to articles to help developers with writing modern React (web) apps. Also includes links to modern Javascript (ES2016-ES2020).

NOTE: Currently these are links I've added to Pocket over the last 12 months, many of which I haven't read. I'm creating this page to help others, and to nudge me to start reading them. As I start reading through these, I will remove the articles that aren't too helpful, so that this page evolves into a list of **vetted** links. 

NOTE 2: Some of these links may require a Medium membership. If you find a link that requires a Medium membership, but the article is also available for free (because it was republished on Medium), please let me know and I'll update the link.

Future: I will consider adding TypeScript links.
